# Fivem Ox Essentials

This package is inspired by the [FiveM Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ViorityGroup.fivem-development) extension package by [Tuncion](https://github.com/Tuncion/). Loved the concept, however, my team and I do not use jquery, qb-core or esx.

I rebuilt it to be used with the [overextended](https://github.com/overextended) ecosystem and will eventually add some Typescript/React extensions as well.

I hope you find this useful, if you have any suggestions or changes feel free to contact me on discord or [open an issue](https://github.com/tclrd/fivem-vscode-extensions/issues/new/choose) on [github](https://github.com/tclrd/fivem-vscode-extensions).
